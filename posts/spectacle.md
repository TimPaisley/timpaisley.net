description: "A web tool build to consolidate, visualise and better understand geographic data."
---

Spectacle is one of the larger projects in development at NEC Smart Cities, currently backed by two dev teams. The tool, which is built using a combination of web technolgies and functional programming languages, is designed to consolidate, visualise and better understand councils' geographic data. By using Spectacle, councils can explore their data like they've never been able to before, helping them to make better decisions for the wellbeing and growth of their cities.

Spectacle came about, much like the Digital City Model, as a result of our relationship with Wellington City Council, and was initially part of the award winning Living Lab project. For the first six months of the project I worked alone on the development of the app, learning Ruby (on Rails), PostgreSQL/PostGIS, Command Line and some basic JavaScript as I worked. The result of my work was a single page tool that could be used to filter and visualise different kinds of geographic data in Wellington, and became well utilised within the Community Safety team at WCC. The original tool is still used to this day in the process of creating Liquor Licence renewal reports. In the early months of 2017 we decided to take a new approach that favoured long-term development as opposed to the quick, iterative prototypes that we'd been developing so far.
