NUMBER STATION is a game made by Micheal Baron, David Boxall, and myself over the course of a weekend for Global Game Jam 2018. We made everything ourselves - Michael made the 3D models to fill out the room in which the game takes place, David composed the music that you can hear on the radio, and I did the coding.

NUMBER STATION is about problem solving and careful attention to detail. The player finds themselves at a desk with a number of items laid out in front of them, and will need to explore the objects at their disposal to undercover three hidden frequencies, which in turn will uncover three secret messages that can be decoded and entered into the terminal to finish the game.
