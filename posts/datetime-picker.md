Picking complex dates or times on a website has never been particularly pleasant. Booking flights will normally involve selecting the days you want to depart to (or arrive from) your destination, and will later provide a list of possible flights and times on your selected day(s). Providing your date of birth will generally involve three dropdowns, maybe a calendar if the developers were feeling particularly ambitious.

How would you approach a situation where your users might need to specify a DateTime value down to the minute? What if we want to select an entire month? Or even any time within a particular week?
